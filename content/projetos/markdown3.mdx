## Markdown for the component era ðŸš€

MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

### What does MDX do?

- You write markdown with embedded components through JSX
- It gets compiled to JavaScript that you can use in any framework that supports JSX
